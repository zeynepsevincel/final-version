        "Great location conveniently situated downtown. Have stayed here a few times for events, and would definitely do so again. Rooms are spacious and well-maintained, and theres a great layout of comfortable couches and amenities in the rooms. Having access to kitchen supplies was very useful for the trip. Staff were friendly and attentive, and desk team was very helpful for any issues. One of the staff - Tony - made sure that everything was in order and also that any additional requirements were taken care of.All in all, a great location with everything you could need, and very attentive staff. Would highly recommend.",

        'Cannot say enough good things about this place. It is a bit old, but everything else about the Sunset Inn is stellar. Spacious and inexpensive rooms. Great views. Free breakfast and laundry. Amazing location close to many great eats. Just quiet enough that you do not feel too urban. Close to the train and major bus routes. Incredibly friendly and helpful staff. Great value. 100% recommend.',
